### System Dependencies

```bash
# Update package list
sudo apt update

# Install system dependencies
sudo apt install -y \
    python3-pip \
    python3-opencv \
    python3-yaml \
    python3-numpy \
    python3-scipy \
    portaudio19-dev \

    ros-noetic-rqt-gui \
    ros-noetic-rqt-gui-py
```

## Setup

### 1. Connect to Jupiter Juno Robot
Connect to your Jupiter Juno robot system and ensure ROS 1 Noetic is installed and properly configured.

### 2. Clone the Project
```bash
# Navigate to your catkin workspace source directory
mkdir ~/assignment
cd ~/assignment

# Clone the Jupiter Juno drowsiness detection system
git clone https://github.com/yangding14/robot_assignment.git
```

### 3. Make Scripts Executable
```bash
# Make Python node scripts executable
chmod +x ~/assignment/robot_assignment/src/jupiter_juno/src/jupiter_juno/*.py
chmod +x ~/assignment/robot_assignment/src/jupiter_juno/src/standalone_gui.py
chmod +x ~/assignment/robot_assignment/src/jupiter_juno/src/test_system_standalone.py
```

### 4. Add Package to ROS Environment
```bash
# Add the package path to ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH:~/assignment/robot_assignment/jupiter_juno/src

# Add this line to your ~/.bashrc for persistence
echo "export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=\$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH:~/assignment/robot_assignment/jupiter_juno/src" >> ~/.bashrc
```

### 5. Build the Package
```bash
# Navigate to catkin workspace root
cd ~/assignment/robot_assignment

# Source ROS environment
source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash

# Build the Jupiter Juno package
catkin_make

# Source the workspace setup
source devel/setup.bash
```

### 6. Configure API Keys
```bash
# Set up Gemini API key for AI conversations (recommended)
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-gemini-api-key-here"

source ~/.bashrc
```

**Note**: The system will work without API keys by using pre-programmed fallback jokes and safety tips instead of AI-generated conversations.

### 7. Setup Python Environment
```bash
# Navigate to the package directory
cd ~/assignment/robot_assignment/jupiter_juno

# Create and activate virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install Python dependencies
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### 8. Launch the System
```bash
# Ensure you're in the catkin workspace and environment is sourced
cd ~/assignment/robot_assignment
source devel/setup.bash

# Launch the complete system with GUI monitor
roslaunch robot_assignment jupiter_juno_complete_system.launch
```

## Monitoring the System

### View Active Topics
```bash
# List all active ROS topics
rostopic list
```

### Monitor System Data
```bash
# Monitor real-time Eye Aspect Ratio values
rostopic echo /jupiter_juno/ear_data

# Monitor drowsiness detection alerts
rostopic echo /jupiter_juno/drowsiness_alert

# Monitor speech recognition results
rostopic echo /jupiter_juno/speech_result

# Monitor system state transitions
rostopic echo /jupiter_juno/system_state

# Monitor TTS requests
rostopic echo /jupiter_juno/tts_request
```

### Visualize System Architecture
```bash
# View ROS computation graph showing node connections
rqt_graph

# View message flow and topic relationships
rqt_plot
```
